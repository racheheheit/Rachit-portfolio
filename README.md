# Rachit-portfolio
This project is my official personal portfolio website, designed to creatively showcase my work, skills, and personality as a frontend developer. Drawing inspiration from the Netflix user interface, the site features a unique "Who's Watching?" role-selection screen that directs different visitor types (Recruiter, Developer, Designer, etc.) to tailored content pages.

Key Highlights:

🎥 Cinematic Landing Page: Includes a custom video intro that plays on interaction, creating an immersive, cinematic experience inspired by Netflix.
🖥️ Role-Based Navigation: Mimics the Netflix profile selection UI, offering interactive access to various themed portfolio sections.
📱 Responsive Design: Built with responsive CSS to deliver a smooth, mobile-friendly experience across all devices.
🧠 JavaScript Interactivity: Custom JS handles video transitions and dynamic content routing based on visitor type.
📂 Clean Code Structure: Assets and code are modularly organized in folders for maintainability.
🌐 Deployed on GitHub Pages: Hosted live using GitHub Pages for public access and version control.
This project showcases my strengths in creative UI/UX design, responsive web development, and attention to detail, all wrapped in a fun, familiar Netflix-inspired interface.
